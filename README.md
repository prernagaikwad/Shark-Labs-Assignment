# Shark-Labs-Assignment
Completed the assignment of Shark Labs.

             1.Predict the price of a house
             2.Product matching
 
#Predict the price of a house 
Objective:The goal is to understand the relationship between house features and how these variables affect the house price
Libraries And Framework:Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib,Scipy,Scikit-learn,scipy,XGBoost,LightGBM
Machine Learning Model Performance by using HyperparameterTuning.

#Product Matching
Objective:Using ML/DL techniques, match similar products from the Flipkart dataset with the Amazon dataset. Once
similar products are matched, display the retail price from FK and AMZ side by side

For example:
FDT Women's Leggings from Flipkart should be matched with FDT WOMEN'S Leggings Pants from Amazon
Libraries And Framework: Pandas ,Numpy ,FuzzyMatcher
A Python package that allows the user to fuzzy match two pandas dataframes based on one or more common fields.
Fuzzymatches uses sqlite3's Full Text Search to find potential matches.It then uses probabilistic record linkage to score matches.
Finally it outputs a list of the matches it has found and associated score.
It then uses probabilistic record linkage to score matches.
